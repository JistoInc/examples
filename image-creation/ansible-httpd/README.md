# Ansible HTTP server  
  
This example uses Ansible to setup and configure a HTTP server 
that runs on port 80.

There are two files in the ansible directory:
* a basic playbook named webserver.yml
* ansible-run.sh script which launches the Ansible client

## Requirements

* Container must have access to the internet
* Jisto agent host must be running Centos 7 or Ubuntu 16.04
